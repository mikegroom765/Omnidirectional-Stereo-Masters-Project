I didn't want to upload code from another paper on this repository so it's not been included here.

For this project I used a pretrained model from the PSMNet GitHub repository : https://github.com/JiaRenChang/PSMNet

If you want to use PSMNet, head over to the link and download their respository and place the contents in this folder.
